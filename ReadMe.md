# Bugs and problems encountered
I had trouble with images for the slide as with sliding the picture size was changing. So I tried to find images with the same size or as close as possible to fit the banner.

# Code attribution
## bootstrap library
This website played a big roll in designing and creating my pages such as navigation bar, sliding banner, form and other details.
## W3school
This website was a valuable library for me and great support for writing my codes.
## Logo maker
There are many websites for logo.However, I used this one https://www.adobe.com/express/create/logo
to create the logo of my page it was useful and served the purpose.


## Image source
I have used the images from those resources to serve my need during the project.

## Deployment

I deployed the website on GitHub platform after making a repository and uploading all the files to it.
GitHub has special requirement with naming the repository for deployment as it needs to be written in this form
 account-holders-name.github.io 
It is important to mention that you can not deploy more than one repository in the same time on GitHub. If you already have a deployed repository you need to stop it by changing the name and deploy the required repository the same way mentioned in the top
There are other platforms for deployment such as (Go dady)
Another important step is the index.html file should be in the root folder to be successfully deployed.

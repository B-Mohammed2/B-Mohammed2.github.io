## Deployment

I deployed the website on GitHub platform after making a repository and uploading all the files to it.
Github has special requirement with naming the repository for deployment as it needs to be written in this form
 account-holders-name.github.io 
It is important to mention that you can not deploy more than one repository in the same time on GitHub. If you already have a deployed repository you need to stop it by changing the name and deploy the required repository the same way mentioned in the top
There are other platform for deployment such as (Go dady)
Another important step is the index.html file should be in the root folder to be successfully deployed.
